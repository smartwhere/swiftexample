Swift Example of the Tune SDK with smartwhere proximity enabled


This iOS project represents a very simple implementation of the Tune SDK enabling Smartwhere Proximity.

**The AppDelegate.swift  must be modified to reflect the target account values.  **

This project uses a cocoapods podfile, so you will need to open the workspace instead of the procject.
